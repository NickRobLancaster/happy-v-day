              I know things have been pretty rocky recently. I'm sorry for that.
              I'm really trying to seek God as much as I can so he can make me
              who I'm suppose to be for you. Anything I'm lacking I know he will
              eventually supply. He's causing us to become more like him as time
              goes on. I'm very greatful to see that you are growing in a lot of
              ways I didn't expect. I'm so proud of all the progress you have
              made in your walk with God. I see see you becoming more and more
              of a Godly woman even with all the things that have been going on
              I do see.

              <br />
              <br />

              With Beckham now, I'm also seeing you become a great mother. If
              you were ever worried you wouldn't be, I can assure you that you
              are.

              <br />
              <br />

              One thing that's been on my mind recently... is that my life is
              not my own and I have to be willing to give it up for you and
              Beckham. I'm not perfect but I'm trying to be better. If I can
              just learn to put God before everyone then I can be the husband
              and father you need me to be. I've already tried on my own and it
              doesn't work. I need God to help me. I'm want to be more patient
              and understanding. I desire to be more loving and kind. I look
              forward to the day that I can be more selfless and sacrificial.
              The list really goes on and on. I'm just trying to be better for
              you and our family. I'm trying to be more like Jesus.

              <br />
              <br />

              I pray God gives you the patience you need with me and that that
              he keeps us in unity and love. I pray that we can continue to grow
              in our marriage but most importantly in our walks with Him and so
              we can be a the best example to our son.

              <br />
              <br />

              God has been so good to us. He's blessed us with more than enough
              now to where we can eventually acheive all the Goals we have set.
              Now we just have to learn to prioritize the intangible things like
              our relationship. The way we speak to eachother. And lifting
              eachother up.

              <br />
              <br />

              I pray you can always find it in your heart to forgive me when I
              fall short.

              <br />
              <br />

              Anyways... I love you and Beckham so much and I'm happy and
              greatful to be able to celebrate this valentines day with you
              both.

              We've made it to the 5 year hump! I'm so happy that we've been
              able to make it this far. According to what statistics say, we are
              much more likely to live out a lifelong marriage once a married
              couple has hit this milestone. I'm so greatful to God for bringing
              us together and for keeping us together (I know we've had a lot of
              things we've felt at times but God has been faithful to his
              promise).

              There's a lot that I'm not worthy of but you continue to show me
              underserved grace in so many areas of our marriage. I'm so
              grateful for you and happy that you're my wife. I love you so much
              and I can't wait to see what the future holds for us. We still

              made me a better man in so many ways).

              don't seem so hard when I'm doing them for Him and you (I guess
